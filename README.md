01. Clock
Write a program that prints the hours of the day from 0:0 to 23:59, each on a separate line.
The hours should be written in the format "{hour}:{minutes}".

    02. Multiplication Table
Print the multiplication table for the numbers 1 to 10 to the console in the format:
"{first factor} * {second factor} = {result}".
Sample Input and Output
Input Output
(no entrance)	1 * 1 = 1
1 * 2 = 2
1 * 3 = 3
1 * 4 = 4
1 * 5 = 5
1 * 6 = 6
1 * 7 = 7
1 * 8 = 8
1 * 9 = 9
1 * 10 = 10
...
10 * 1 = 10
10 * 2 = 20
10 * 3 = 30
10 * 4 = 40
10 * 5 = 50
10 * 6 = 60
10 * 7 = 70
10 * 8 = 80
10 * 9 = 90
10 * 10 = 100

03. Combinations
Write a program that calculates how many solutions in natural numbers (including zero) the equation has:
x1 + x2 + x3 = n
The number n is an integer and is entered from the console.
Sample input and output
Input Output Explanations                                                 Input Output Input Output
25    351    We generate all combinations of 5 numbers, the first one is: 20    231    5     21
             0+0+0=0, but since it is not equal to 25, we continue:
             0+0+1=1 â€“ also not 25, etc.
            We reach the first valid combination:
            0 + 0 + 25 = 25, we increase the number of valid
            combinations by 1,
            the second valid combination is:
            0 + 1 + 24 = 25
            The third:
            0 + 2 + 23 = 25, etc.
            After generating all possible combinations,
            the number of valid ones is 351.
